            <h1> TAPAS </h1>
                <p class="text-p">A tapa in Spain is an aperitif that is served in most bars or restaurants accompanying the drink (alcohol or not) .1 This itinerant consumption (local, consumption and new local) is called tapas, or going for tapas . In many regions of Spain it is quite common to go out to dinner or to eat on weekends with tapas, a way of eating usually referred to as nibbling or snacking.

                    Tapas have become a sign of Spanish identity and are offered at reception banquets to the highest dignitaries (in the so-called tapas meeting) .3 Thus, during the Madrid Peace Conference, Queen Sofía and the mayor of Madrid José María Álvarez del Manzano invited Raísa Gorbachova to a drink with a cover during her visit to the Spanish capital.4 In modern times there are bars that offer tapas specialties and this phenomenon has been called miniature cuisine. However, the concept of tapas has been brought to haute cuisine by the chef Ferran Adrià who uses them as entrees.</p>
