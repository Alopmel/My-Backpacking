            <h1> CRAFT BEERS </h1>
                <p class="text-p">Fortunately for all of us who are part of the exciting world of alcoholic beverages, hospitality establishments and consumers have gradually opened up to a new beer dimension that offers a much broader offer. A new scenario that allows the brewer to experiment with new proposals and more complex aromas that have also been incorporated into the world of cocktails, with new recipes made with beer.</p>
            </br>

                <p class="text-p">In less than a decade, the number of craft beer factories in Spain has multiplied by 7. In 2010, there were barely 70, while in 2019 we already had 517.

                    A similar phenomenon is found in the production of craft beer in Spain, which has multiplied by 22. Going from about 20,000 hl in 2011 to 450,000 hl in 2018.
                    
                    Even with this "exponential" growth, craft beer accounts for just 1.17% of total beer production in Spain, which according to the 2018 Spanish Brewers Society report, stands at 38.4 million hl. Which means that the growth potential of this type of beer is brutal.</p>

                <p class="text-p">
                    Although there are countless national and international beer classifications and festivals, we have found it interesting to resort to the ranking of one of the beer fairs with the greatest tradition and respect in our country: the Barcelona Beer Festival. In whose 2019 Palmarés the following Spanish craft beer brands stood out:
                </p></br>
