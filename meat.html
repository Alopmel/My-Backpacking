                <p class="text-p">Beef is one of the main components of the Mediterranean diet, among the healthiest in the world. Due to the variety of cuts and the type of animals, Spanish beef is very versatile from a gastronomic point of view, with multiple culinary possibilities and for all tastes.

                    And the fact is that the Spanish territory, with its great diversity, offers a multitude of possibilities to enjoy this type of meat. For this reason, the Interprofessional Organization of Beef (Provacuno), has wanted to collect, according to the geographical area in question, the best beef dishes, in most cases true typical dishes of each region.</p>
