            <h1> Gastronomy </h1>
                <p class="p-tittle"> The varied concept of cuisine causes some authors to call it in the plural, as the “kitchens of Spain.” In today's Spanish cuisine, two realities coexist: classic and popular cuisine based on tradition, and the current cuisine that uses the most innovative and ingenious signature cooking techniques, with chefs who have achieved recognized international fame.1 Despite this, classic cuisine has very deep religious roots. Some typical ways of eating from the Spanish regions have become internationalized, just as tapas can be: Among the Spanish ingredients, the cheeses are worth highlighting, which are of a great variety, the result of a thousand-year-old livestock activity. The great variety of wines it possesses also stands out in Spanish gastronomy, some of its wine regions having achieved international fame and recognition. Although wine is the national drink, in some northern regions other drinks are very popular, such as cider.</p>

         <h3> Wine </h3>
         <p>
            From a climatic point of view, Spain can produce practically all styles of wine except those from very cold regions. The location of the Iberian Peninsula in a mid-latitude of the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere makes it an interesting crossroads of influences.</p>
