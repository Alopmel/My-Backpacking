            <h1> ASTURIAN CIDER CULTURE </h1>
                <p class="text-p">
                    Asturian cider is a symbol of identity, deeply rooted and differentiated from other territories and cultures. One of the most characteristic fruits of Asturias is the apple, where there are more than 500 types, and it constitutes the essence of cider. This production process begins in the spring with the flowering of the apple tree, a spectacle to be seen in the pomaradas - a group of apple trees -, and continues in the winery or 'llagar' in Asturian, where it is transformed into cider. In Asturias, more than 45 million liters of cider are produced, distributed among the 80 wineries in the region, located mainly in Gijón, Villaviciosa, Nava and Siero. Of all this production, 95% is consumed in Asturias, which in turn is the Community that produces 80% of the cider made in Spain. Consumption is carried out preferably in restaurants, cider houses and 'llagares', where the typical gastronomic festivals known as 'espichas' are usually held, and it is also very common, especially in spring and summer, its consumption in pilgrimages and festivals.</p>
                    
                <h2> The only cider that is poured in the world </h2>
                    <p class="text-p">
                        Asturian cider has the uniqueness that it is the only one poured in the world. What is pouring cider and for what reason is it done? It is the act of serving the cider by pouring it with the upright arm, taking the bottle with the right hand and the glass with the left, with the thumb and forefinger surrounding the glass and the heart at the bottom. After adopting this position, the cider falls from a considerable height abruptly and 'back', that is, it breaks into a foam when it hits the edge of the glass. Adequate 'oxygenation' is assured and the cider is ready to drink in one gulp or 'culin', as it is said in 'slang'. In addition, the entire content of the glass is not drunk, but a little is left to clean where it has been drunk, since in natural cider glass is shared. A show full of technique and tradition.
