            <h1> WINE </h1>
                <p class="text-p">Generalizing about Spanish wine is complicated. Simplifying is a mistake. The rediscovery of wine regions that has been a constant in the last 20 years and that hopefully is not slowed down by the current crisis, has only added more variables to the equation. All this translates into new and exciting styles that go beyond those solidly settled in the mind of the international consumer (Rioja, Ribera, Galician whites, Cavas, perhaps also Txakoli and Mencía) And local.</p>
            
                <h2> Diversity </h2>
                <p class="text-p">
                    As long as global warming allows it, we can enjoy the sharp acidity of txakolis or the crisp freshness of many Galician wines. Reds in particular are the last great discovery of Atlantic or Green Spain. They are light years away from the natural maturity that is achieved in the Mediterranean regions or from the austerity typical of a more rigorous climate such as the Valle del Duero. Regions like Rioja can be much more versatile. Its producers are increasingly getting more out of it by distinguishing between Atlantic and Mediterranean vintages and exploring the personality of more specific areas.
                </p></br>

                <h2> Moutains </h2>
                <p class="text-p">
                    Spain is a country of rugged orography. Mountains contribute significantly to shaping the landscape: they delimit wine regions (with the consequent isolation effect that accentuates localities), act as protective barriers, contain or create corridors for breezes or beneficial winds for the vineyard.
Growing on slopes often improves exposure to the sun or, on the contrary, seeks cooler exposures, benefits from better drainage, avoids frosts that always affect the valley more ...
Some of the most spectacular wine landscapes in Spain (and which are worth seeing at least once in your life) are found in rugged regions of dramatic beauty: the most famous are Ribeira Sacra, Priorat, Gredos or Axarquía, but many others have a wild and mountainous part: the slopes of the Sierra de Cantabria or Monte Yerga in Rioja, the mountain vineyards of Calatayud and other regions of Aragon, or the high and rugged areas of Bierzo ... Many of the most exciting wines made now Even in Spain they come from mountain vineyards.
                </p></br>

                <h2> Organic vineyards and wines </h2>
                <p class="text-p">
                    Spain is the country with the largest organic vineyard area in the world. The dry and airy climate of large areas of the country naturally favors ecological work in the vineyard.
In 2018 there were 113,500 hectares, 11.8% of the total vineyard cultivated in the country. There are more than 1,000 certified organic producers. In Bullas (Murcia), 80% of the DO vineyards have organic certification.
Many producers and winegrowers are in the process of conversion, so these figures will continue to grow in the coming years.
