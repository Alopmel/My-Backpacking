            <h1> Alhambra Palace </h1>
                <p class="text-p"> Separate from the city of Granada itself, the famous Alhambra and all that it contains—royal halls and residences, brimming gardens, marble patios, and military barracks—have been a star attraction of the region for centuries.</p></br>
                <p class="text-p"> Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, the Alhambra got its start under the Nasrid dynasty, the last line of Muslim sultans to rule over the Iberian Peninsula. With high ramparts that span a mile in circumference—not to mention 30 watchtowers, and 4 nearly impenetrable gates—it’s endured countless sieges, demolitions, and additions over the years.</p></br>
                <p class="text-p"> Even more breathtaking than the resilience of its walls? The depth of its history. Other, younger Muslim palaces can certainly be found, but none are as old as the Alhambra, which went up in the 1300s. “People from Granada are very proud of the Alhambra and their city,  Al Hambra Palce walls Many inscriptions are phrases like “There is no victor but Allah” which appears many times. There are lots of recurring words such as “happiness” or “blessing” that appear throughout the palace. These words are there to protect the monarch honoured in each courtyard.</p></br>
                <p class="text-p"> Other phrases appear like: “Rejoice in good fortune, because Allah helps you” or “Be sparse in words and you will go in peace.”</p></br>
                <p class="text-p"> It is likely that the artists choosing these texts for the palace walls were poets but also politicians. This wall decoration is an elaborate form of political propaganda. Palace officials reflected the authority and power of the Sultan through its decoration.  Visible to anyone entering the rooms at the heart of the Al-Andalus kingdom. It’s no accident that the Alhambra was built just four miles from a major river. This was needed to supply water to the bubbling fountains, rectangular pools, marble baths around which each section of the palace was centered. Flowerbeds and the abundant greenery needed watering, too, so run-off from the fountains was used as irrigation. Meanwhile, many of the royal residences contained toilets with flushing cisterns—not bad for the 1400s, right?
